```

The output seems like binary, so we will add "From Binary" into the recipe.

The output seems encrypted using a rotation cipher. Let's use ROT47 to decrypt it.

Finally, click on the magic wand to get the final message.

Base64 > Morse Code > Binary > ROT47 > Decimal

## Task 2. Spectrograms

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls. 

First thing first, download the task files. We will get a WAV audio file. Upload that for Spectral Analysis to get the flag.

## Task 3. Steganography

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

Download the task files. We will get a jpeg image file. As the question suggest, we will use `steghide` from Kali to obtain the flag.

## Task 4. Security through obscurity

Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.

### 1. Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?

Using `binwalk -e meme.jpg`, we can get some additional files from the jpg image.

From the additional files we got, we can get the answer to this question.

### 2. Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.

Using `strings hackerchat.png`, we can obtain the answer.
